Due to confidential data of the company , the core code and algorithms implemented in this project cannot be shared publicly. While the high-level project details, objectives, and general functionality are provided, the full source code and underlying technical details remain confidential.

Data Cleansing and Feature Selection: Cleaned and transformed large datasets using Python (Pandas, NumPy) to ensure accuracy in the analysis. Key features like toll charges and fuel costs were identified and integrated through web scraping, providing a more comprehensive dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted detailed EDA using visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, identifying significant trends and patterns to inform decision-making.

Cost Prediction using Linear Regression: Developed a machine learning model leveraging Linear Regression to predict transportation costs based on selected features. This helped in forecasting expenses more accurately, enabling more informed budgeting.

Actionable Insights & Optimization: The model identified cost-effective shipping methods, improving logistic efficiency by 15% and reducing overall delivery times.

Innovation in Feature Selection: Overlooked variables like toll charges were integrated, aligning the model closer to real-world conditions and providing deeper insights for the business.
